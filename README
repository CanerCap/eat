Additional Information
- During the projects development I was unable to able to open any sort of project in the IDE Netbeans.
After discussions with my lecturers I was advised to try another IDE so this was coded in Intellij IDEA

- I've had many issues with the dependency JSTL and I was unable to implement it's forEach functionality.
The lectures have been made aware of this issue yet we were all unable to solve this issue.
On the LessonTimeTableView I have also included direct calls to the data to prove it was accessible from the view.
